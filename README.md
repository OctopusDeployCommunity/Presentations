# Presentations

The content of this repository is available for you so you can reproduce any demo or learn how to present sessions you have seen the [Octopus Community team present](https://github.com/OctopusDeployCommunity/Community-Team) allowing you to present at a community user group, or even as a lunch-and-learn event for your company.

## Presenting the content

We're glad you are here and look forward to your delivery of this amazing content. As an experienced presenter, we know you know HOW to present so this guide will focus on WHAT you need to present. It will provide you a full run-through of the presentation created by the presentation design team.

Along with the video of the presentation, this repository will link to all the assets you need to successfully present including PowerPoint slides and demo instructions & code.
