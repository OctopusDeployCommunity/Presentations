## Session Abstract

Automation is key these days, to save time and avoid mistakes.

Bicep is a new Domain Specific Language (DSL) that drastically simplifies the way of writing Infrastructure as Code for the Azure platform.

In this session we'll go over this new language and learn how to get started.

We'll then look at how you can automate the deployment of your infrastructure as code using Octopus Deploy's Runbook capabilities.

## Get Started

This training repository is divided in to the following sections:

| [Slides](#slides) | [Demos](demos/README.md) | [Deployment](deployment/README.md) | 
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------
| 42 slides - 25 minutes, | 4 demos - 20 minutes, | 1 automated deployment



## Slides

The [slides](presentations.md) are divided in five sections:
